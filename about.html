    <p >If you've made it this far, I figure you're a at least a little bit interested in who I am - so I'll give you a little bit of info here! </p>
    <p> I was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and was a fairly normal kid growing up. The one thing that set me a little bit apart from my peers was my drive to travel and experience different cultures. This drive has led me into who I am today.
    </p>
    <p> From a very young age I dreamt of moving and living in a different country and learning a new language. In 2012 I was able to see this dream fulfilled when I moved to Tokyo, Japan.  I had considered study abroad before this, but didn't want to be restricted to staying for only one or two semesters - I really wanted to LIVE within the culture, rather than possibly feel like a constant visitor - or someone who had a return ticket home. With this in mind I applied to and attended a university that was based in Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p> My experience in Japan was amazing, everyday was an adventure for me and while at times things were exhausting, tough, confusing, etc. - I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every minute of it.  I realized that even with moving my want for more travel and more adventure only grew. Eventually it grew to the point that I was pushed to move once again.
    </p>
    <p> In 2014 I made the choice to transfer to a Taiwanese university and study in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. I wanted to experience a different part of Asia, a part that maybe felt more "raw" or authentic.(Don't get me wrong Tokyo was authentic but at times didn't feel like much of a change from a large US city.) Again just like Tokyo, I enjoyed every minute - The struggles with the langauge, the culture, the weather - everything was a challenge and I loved that I had a challenge every day.
    </p>
    <p> From this point I realized that not only adventure drives me - but being challenged does as well.  Throughout all my studies I didn't feel the sense of challenge that I wanted.  I didn't feel pushed or driven.  I realized that I needed to pursue something that would challenge me on a regular basis, and give me satisfaction in succeeding in - This led me to development, and eventually DBC.  I want to be in a field that is always changing, and requiring individuals to "keep up" - I want to be challenged and driven in all aspects of my life, and I believe this is the place to do it.
