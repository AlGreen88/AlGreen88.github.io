      For the past few years I've lived abroad and tried my best to immerse myself in the local cultures. So, to now finally be back stateside in my home country, I find it a little funny that I am again presented with the challenge of immersion. But, I think that's the part of the DBC experience that attracted me the most. I want an experience that is immersive, challenging, and takes you out of your comfort zone. I think that I operate best in these types of situations, and after living abroad, being out of my comfort zone on a daily basis, I feel that I am going to NEED that excitement of being challenged and being pushed to really enjoy what I do. I know that at times I will be nervous, scared, lost, confused, etc - but at the same time happy that I have pushed myself to this point, and am surrounded by others who also like the challenge.

        After now finishing week 1 and learning more about the environment of DBC and the culture of DBC, my expectations haven't changed, but I do feel more confident in my choice to attend.  What set DBC apart for me was the focus on culture, and the focus on an individual as a human being, and not just a developer.  I don't want a program that will simply improve my development abilities. I want a program that will develop me. As it was mentioned in the video, this should be lived as an experience, not a product or service - and I think all good experiences have you grow and improve as a person.

        With all of the confidence I have in myself and in DBC, I am still nervous of course. I am 100 percent excited to be in this type of learning environment, and feel this type of environment is where I learn best. But, the intensity of the program does have me intimidated. I am used to being thrown head first into things that are completely foreign to me - and at the same time I'm human, and I think it's only normal to have that "what am I getting myself into" moment -but I know I am not the only one feeling this way - and can already tell that my cohort will band together to pull eachother through so that we can all make sense of this immersive experience.
