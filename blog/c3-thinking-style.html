  <h2><div>Learning, and Learning to Learn as an Abstract Random Thinker</div></h2>

      After taking the self-test to see what thinking style I have, I've learned that I have a abstract random thinking style.  In name only, I disagreed with this, but after learning about the traits associated with abstract random thinkers, I totally agree.

      I work at my best while working in a group, and being able to discuss with others a possible solution or answer, when working alone I tend to second guess what I think could be done, and for some odd reason have a fear in trying and experimenting.  I find it easier to experiment and work through things in a group setting, and while we have the peer pairings, it is for sure a struggle for me in phase 0 to spend the bulk of my time working alone, and only having myself to bounce ideas off of.  I also tend to learn by doing, and thankfully phase 0 has plenty of this...but I have noticed that when it comes to the releases that are reading heavy I tend to get lost, or easily confuesed by the material.  This confusion quickly goes away though once I get the opportunity to try things out myself.

      To help myself overcome these struggles I think I will start to look into ways that can help improve comprehension while reading material.  I am confident in my ability to go through something like the exercises, but I need to work on learning to not misunderstand or misread instructions, material, etc.  I am sure this is all just the next step in my personal development in phase 0.
