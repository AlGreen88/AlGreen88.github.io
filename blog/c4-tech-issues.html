      As I think about issues facing the world and technology, the first thing that comes to mind is education.  I feel that our education system can not keep up with technological advances, and is too slow to react to really capitalize on the progress that has been made.  I believe our students are neglected in this, and that there are plenty of missed opportunities just due to the resistance to innovation, and new thought in how education should be handled.  Another issue is that technology is now allowing students to educate themselves, and develop their own opinions independent of a classroom setting - granted this isn't in every case, but the ability to do this exists now.  I think that to really create an educational environment that supports advances in technology, accepting change and innovation need to be key parts of the educators we put into the classroom.

      While I don't think there is a "quick fix" for this issue, I feel that some approach needs to happen before our education system gets too far behind.  Educators need to accept that change is going to happen, and its better to accept them in a positive way than to just flat out resist.  Students can now learn things in the matter of a quick search, and it's going to come down to our educators to eventually not teach what the answer is, but rather the most effective and efficient way to find that answer with the technology that is available.
