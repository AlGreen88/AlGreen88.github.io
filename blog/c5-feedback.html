    Something completely new to me at DBC is pairing.  While I have worked on teams, and in groups many times before, This is the first time that I have ever really felt anxiety from having to do so.  I think this comes about from not really knowing my pair and what to expect.  While I think pairing is great, and definitely an awesome part of DBC, I still get this anxiety nearly everytime before I pair.

    A great part about pairing at DBC is that we recieve feedback fairly quickly after we pair. The big part about of this feedback is that it needs to be kind, actionable, and specific.  Kind - because feedback that is not kind can end up leading to being counterproductive. Actionable - because feedback should include something that can be improved etc. Specific - because if the feedback is vague the one receiving the feedback might misunderstand or not know where to work on.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of this creates a vulnerable situation for the students at DBC, we have to open ourselves up to criticism, and when reading the feedback given to us we must act on it, rather than feel put down by it.  We must step out of our comfort zones to really make improvements and to grow as individuals, not just as developers.
