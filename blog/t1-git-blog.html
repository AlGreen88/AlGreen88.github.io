    <p>
      Version control allows us to track changes and modifications we have made to our code over time.  This is beneficial because not only does it allow us to easily monitor the changes being made, it allows us to go back to previous working versions of our code. This can come in handy if a change is made and results in buggy or non working code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git helps us track our changes through the processs of staging and commiting changes. A commit can be viewed simply as a savepoint, or taking a snapshot of our current code. We are able to go back to previous commits if need be, and are able to monitor exactly what was deleted, changed, modified, or inserted. Also, we can add messages to each commit that allows us to easily remember what each commit is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Using Github to store code is very benefical.  It allows us to share our code for others to view, modify, and give feedback on. It also allows us to work on a team remotely.  Team members can pull from Github, modify and then push back to Github.  This allows teams to work on the same thing without stepping on eachother's toes. In short, storing your code on Github allows for feedback, and creates an good environment for collaboration.
