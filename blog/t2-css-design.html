  <h2><div>Making Sense of Positioning</div></h2>

    This week I began delving into the worlds of html and css.  I hadn't had any previous experience with either, and coming into the week I was feeling a bit nervous about it all but overall pretty excited.  One concept that took me awhile to wrap my head around was positioning with the abolute, fixed, and relative properties.  In this post I will try to cover what each means, and why you might use them.
    </p>
    ABSOLUTE - Absolute positioning allows you to place elements anywhere you'd like, by letting you set the top, bottom, left, and right properties.  While this can be quite useful, you must also keep in mind that if you use absolute positioning on one of your elements, it will not interact with any other elements that are on the page.
    <p>
    FIXED - Fixed positioning is when you would like to place an element on the page, but you would like it's position to stay the same regardless of scrolling up or down the page.  You might see this on site's that have a sidebar.  The position isn't relative to other elements, but is relative to the browser window.
    </p>
    <p>
    RELATIVE - Relative positioning is used when you would like to move an element relative to where it would be on the page normally.  By changing it's top, bottom, left, or right properties you move it in the direction you'd like with a starting point of where the element originally was.
    </p>

    I find myself still getting tripped up on these concepts, but know with more time and practice it will all click.  As much as it is easy to read and think you understand the idea, it's best to put it in to practice and work with it yourself.  Hopefully, it makes a little more sense now, if you had any confusion with these positioning properties.
