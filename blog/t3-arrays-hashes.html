  <h2><div>Getting Aquainted With Arrays and Hashes</div></h2>

    This week I moved into the wonderful world of Ruby, and was introduced to several new words, concepts, and ideas.  From objects and methods, to floats and strings I started to try and understand all the terminology I was presented with.  Two completely new things to me were arrays and hashes, which I will talk about in this post.
    </p>
    <p>
        ARRAYS - An array in ruby is just a list of things put into order.  This can be a list of numbers, words, etc.  As stated before these these items are kept in order starting from 0.  So the first item in your array would be attached to 0 the second to 1 and so on and so forth.

    </p>
    <p>
        HASHES - Just like an array, a hash is a list of things, but in this case not necesarrily stored in order - they are stored with a key.  Each item in a hash has a key that will call it into play.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now if both arrays and hashes are used to store information, when do we decide to use one or the other? Well we know that arrays store information in an ordered list, so if we ever were storing information that needed to be in a particular order, and we know that hashes store information using a key and can be given unique values.  So for need to be ordered lists stick with arrays, while lists that need to be a little more unique go with hashes.
