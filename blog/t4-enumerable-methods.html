      Now that I have had a couple weeks to play around with Ruby I am trying to get a better understanding of the methods I am using to complete the challenges I am faced with.  One of these methods - each - has come up often, and has proven to be very useful. I will talk a little bit about the method in this blog post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each is actually fairly simple, each just goes through each item in the object you called it on, and from there you can modify, perform actions on each item. It then returns the original object that you called it on.  When you maybe have an array with items you'd like to modify, each allows you to do that in a straightforward way.

    </p>
    <p>
      While I am sure there is plenty more I need to learn about this method, I am pretty confident in using it - and feel like it is one of the easier methods out there to utilize.  I also think that I will probably be seeing this method more often than not.
